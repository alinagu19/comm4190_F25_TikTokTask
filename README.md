# comm4190_F25_TikTokTask

In this project, we took a TikTok video and examined the comments for opposing stances. We chose a Dancing with the Stars video of Whitney Leavitt and her partner dancing, and the opposing stances were either in favor of her (and her dance) or against her (and her dance). 

After encoding comments and then prompting an LLM to do the same, we found that although comments praising Whitney are more frequent, the comments "hating" on her are more popular in terms of likes.
